        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-800 font-mono max-w-2xl leading-relaxed">
          Pickleball was invented in the summer of 1965 on Bainbridge Island, Washington. It began as a backyard game,
          created by Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum, who improvised with a badminton court, wooden paddles,
          and a perforated plastic ball. <br /><br />
          The game quickly gained popularity due to its accessibility and fun, blending elements of tennis, badminton,
          and ping-pong. Over the years, pickleball has evolved into an internationally recognized sport, with dedicated courts,
          professional tournaments, and millions of players worldwide.
